# -Analyzing-Suicide-Rate-Trends-in-the-United-States
Using Python 🇺🇸  In this project, I explored U.S. suicide rates across time, gender, age groups, and racial/ethnic categories using publicly available CDC data.


 The goal was to uncover key insights and trends that could help inform public health discussions and promote greater awareness.

🔍 Key Objectives:

Examine how suicide rates have changed over the years

Compare male and female suicide rates

Analyze differences across racial and ethnic groups

Identify which age groups are most affected

Understand broader patterns and statistical trends in the data

🚀 Project Highlights:

Cleaned and structured the dataset using Pandas

Conducted statistical comparisons using T-tests

Created visualizations: histograms, bar charts, donut charts, heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Calculated core statistics: mean, median, mode

🛠️ Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy
